# Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to my data science portfolio. 
This repository showcases a collection of my projects in **Python, SQL, Data Analytics, Data Visualisation and Automation**.

Each project demonstrates a specific area of expertise — from anomaly detection and CI/CD pipelines to SQL analytics and data visualisation.

## Projects

### 1. [Transport Wellbeing Analytics Platform](./transport-wellbeing-analytics-platform)
Gathered and altered data and presented my findings on a dashboard.
- Used public datasets to produce reports of transport and wellbeing data.
- SQL and DAX commands to create an infromative Power BI dashboard.

### 2. [Dynamic Flight Model Simulation](./flight-pricing-model)
Developed a dynamic simulation to represent flight mechanics.  
- Modeled trajectories using Python and NumPy.  
- Visualized stability responses and time-series data.

### 3. [Business Insights Reporting (SQL)](./business-insights-sql)
Analyzed customer and sales data using SQL to uncover business insights.  
- Optimized queries for inventory management.  
- Includes Power BI/Excel visualizations.

### 4. [Python Anomaly Detector](./python-anomaly-detector)
Automated data validation using Pandas and PyTest.  
- Detects missing values, schema mismatches, and outliers.  
- Integrated with GitHub Actions for CI/CD testing.

### 5. [Automated Testing Pipeline (Python)](./automated-testing-pipeline)
Built a CI/CD workflow using GitHub Actions and PyTest.  
- Ensured code reliability with automated testing.  
- Demonstrated MLOps fundamentals for Python projects.
